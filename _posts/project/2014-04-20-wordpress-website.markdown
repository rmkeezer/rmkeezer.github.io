####Wordpress Website
Created and completed a business website for a client. 
This involved working with Wordpress, MySQL, Filezilla 
and various other tools to host the website and allow 
for easy maintenance by the client. Also edited many 
back-end Javascript and CSS files to revamp the look 
and feel of the template design.
